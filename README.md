**How To:**

You just need to replace the following image files:

>     cpiCalbg5.png, calnum.png and markday.png on ~/launcher/skin/default/sys.py/gameshell/icons
> 
>     calendar.png to ~/launcher/skin/default/Menu/GameShell


**Note:** 
*I'm don't know anything about design tools, I did all changes by KolourPaint on Linux, I did not manage to put the numbers(calnum.png) lined up, there is some wake on it if you know how to do fix it, feel free to change and let me know. I have to use the font.* **Eurostile MN**.
